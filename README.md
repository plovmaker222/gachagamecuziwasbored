A very simple "collect-them-all" game where the user clicks a button to reveal character images at random.

Currently, there is no goal in this "game". The only functionality is:
- Roll to get random characters, with various rarities.
- View already "found" characters.
- Characters that were "not found" yet will not be displayed on the corresponding button press.
- Headache-inducing background GIF.
- Total lack of design whatsoever.
- Fixed odds for different rarities.
